Using U.S census data I try to predict whether or not somebody makes above or below 50k per year based off of a variety of variables 
including education, sex, race, and age. I use a decision tree model because alot of the data is categorical and can be seperated 
using binary/dummy variables i.e 1/0 true/false.
